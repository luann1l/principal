                <img Class = "photo" src="/img/747.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <p>The Boeing 747 is a long-range wide-body airliner designed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States between 1968 and 2023. After the introduction of the 707 in October 1958, Pan Am wanted a jet 2+1⁄2 times its size, to reduce its seat cost by 30%. In 1965, Joe Sutter left the 737 development program to design the 747. In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 Boeing 747-100 aircraft, and in late 1966, Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop the JT9D engine, a high-bypass turbofan. On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the custom-built Everett Plant, the world's largest building by volume. The 747's first flight took place on February 9, 1969, and the 747 was certified in December of that year. It entered service with Pan Am on January 22, 1970. The 747 was the first airplane called a "Jumbo Jet" as the first wide-body airliner.<br>

                <h2>Novo Boeing 777x Já Tem Data De Lançamento</h2>
                <img Class = "photo" src="/img/2.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <p>The Boeing 777X is the latest series of the long-range, wide-body, twin-engine jetliners in the Boeing 777 family from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The 777X features new GE9X engines, new composite wings with folding wingtips, greater cabin width and seating capacity, and technologies from the Boeing 787. The 777X was launched in November 2013 with two variants: the 777-8 and the 777-9. The 777-8 provides seating for 395 passengers and has a range of 8,745 nmi (16,196 km; 10,064 mi) while the 777-9 has seating for 426 passengers and a range of over 7,285 nmi (13,492 km; 8,383 mi).
                    The 777X program was proposed in the early 2010s with assembly at the Boeing Everett Factory and the wings built at a new adjacent building. As of June 2024, there are 501 total orders for the 777X passenger and freighter versions from thirteen identified customers and unnamed buyer(s).[5] The 777-9 first flew on January 25, 2020, with deliveries delayed multiple times and expected to begin in 2026.[3]<br>

                <p>The Boeing F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet are a series of American supersonic twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft derived from the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, in service with the armed forces of the U.S., Australia, and Kuwait. The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced versions of the F/A-18C and D Hornet, respectively.
                    A strike fighter capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground/surface missions, the Super Hornet has an internal 20mm M61A2 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles, and a variety of other weapons. Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external air-to-air refueling system. Although officially named "Super Hornet", it is commonly referred to as "Rhino" within the U.S. Navy.<br>

                <p>The Boeing 737 Max has been described as "the most scrutinized transport aircraft in history" after a series of safety issues.

                    The latest incident occurred on Friday (5/1), when an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 lost part of its fuselage in mid-flight and had to make an emergency landing in the state of Oregon, in the United States.
                    
                    The aircraft, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely in Portland.
                    
                    Following the incident, the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), ordered "immediate inspections" of some Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft.

                <p>The Boeing 757 is an American narrow-body airliner designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The then-named 7N7, a twinjet successor for the trijet 727, received its first orders in August 1978. The prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982, and it was FAA certified on December 21, 1982. Eastern Air Lines placed the initial 757-200 variant in commercial service on January 1, 1983. A package freighter (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 and a combi model in September 1988. The stretched 757-300 was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. After 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest 737 NG variants as a successor to the -200.<br>

                <h2>mcdonnell douglas é Comprada por Boeing!</h2>
                <img Class = "photo" src="/img/10.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <p>The history of McDonnell Douglas illustrates well how American industry works (tendency towards oligopolies and monopolies) and the role of the American government in promoting these companies through defense funds from the Pentagon. McDonnell Douglas was an American aircraft manufacturer resulting from the merger of McDonnell and Douglass in 1968. Between the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas was one of the largest manufacturers of commercial aircraft in the world, manufacturing classics such as the DC-3, DC-8, DC-9 and DC-10. McDonnell was a manufacturer of military aircraft. Both companies merged due to economic problems at Douglas. After the merger, the company became one of the largest manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft in the world, launching models such as the F-15, MD-80 and MD-90, MD-11 and MD-90. However, the company continued to suffer economically, eventually being bought by Boeing for $13 billion in 1996. A very similar story occurred with Lockheed Martin. Imagine if it would be possible for a foreign company to acquire one of these American companies that went through difficulties?<br>
